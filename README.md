# pixel-art-maker
This Pixel art maker (https://i-shubhamprakash.github.io/pixel-art-maker/ ) is a single-page web app which I made as a project during my udacity Web development course; It allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas! It will provide users the options to let them create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!
